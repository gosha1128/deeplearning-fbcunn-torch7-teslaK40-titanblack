# fbcunn-torch7-teslaK40-titanblack

I run Deep machine learning algorithms on a system with super high end GPU cards from Invidia. It wasn't easy getting that up and running :)  I hope these instructions and examples are useful to any of you having trouble getting your cards humming. 

If you are up and running, then checkout my examples below.  They should be useful starting points for your own work.

[ This is a work in progress so bear with me...]

# Installation

## Prerequisites

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## iTorch/ConvNet_On_Cifar_GPU

This is an iTorch script, based entirely on Soumith Chantala's excellent example [ LINK ], presented at the NextML Workshop at Galvanize SOMA in January 2015.  I've made a few changes which demonstrate how to marshal tensors to the GPU memory.
