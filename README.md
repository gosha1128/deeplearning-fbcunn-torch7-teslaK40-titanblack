# fbcunn-torch7-teslaK40-titanblack

It was not easy getting to high-end Invidia GPUs in the same system :)  I hope these instructions and examples are useful to any of you having similar problems getting a system like this up and running.  I've also included examples that demonstrate the full power of the FBCunn Torch7 Deep Learning library.

[ This is a work in progress so bear with me...]

## Prerequisites

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* One or both already installed:
    *  TeslaK40 NVidia Graphics Card
    *  Titan Black NVidia Graphics Card

## Updating Ubuntu

[ TBD ]

## Checking Your Hardware

[ TBD ]

## Installing The Cuda Drive

## Installing the Cuda Sample Code

[ TBD ]

## Running DeviceQuery

[ TBD ]

## Installing IPython

[ TBD ]

## Installing Facebook FAIR Torch7 Deep Learning Libraries

## iTorch/Train_ConvNet_On_Cifar_GPU

This is an iTorch script, based entirely on Soumith Chantala's example [ LINK ], presented at the NextML Workshop at Galvanize SOMA in January 2015.  I've made a few changes which demonstrate how to marshal tensors to the GPU memory.
